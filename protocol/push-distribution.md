description: How PUSH will be distributed upon supply expansion
---

# PUSH Distribution

At the beginning of every epoch, if the time-weighted average price (TWAP) of PUSH is greater than 1.01, new PUSH will be minted in the [Boardroom](boardroom.md).

The amount of new PUSH distributed depends on our position above peg and also the current circulating supply of PUSH.

| Circulating Supply | Max PUSH Minted |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| 500k or less       | 4.5% expansion  |
| Up to 1M           | 4% expansion    |
| Up to 1.5M         | 3.5% expansion  |
| Up to 2M           | 3% expansion    |
| Up to 5M           | 2.5% expansion  |
| Up to 10M          | 2% expansion    |
| Up to 20M          | 1.5% expansion  |
| Up to 50M          | 1.25% expansion |
| 50M+               | 1% expansion    |
