# xPUSH - PUSH Staking

![The PUSH staking user interface](../.gitbook/assets/push\_staking.png)

### What is xPUSH?

xPUSH is a utility token for the PUSH Money protocol. You must hold xPUSH in your wallet to be able to vote on decisions that will shape the future of PUSH Money. The more xPUSH you hold, the more power your vote will carry.

### How Does xPUSH Work?

PUSH can be exchanged to and from xPUSH at any time on our [xPUSH page](https://app.bomb.money/xbomb).

When xPUSH was launched, the ratio of PUSH to xPUSH was exactly 1.0. At a ratio of 1.0, if you deposited 100 PUSH, you would receive 100 xPUSH in return. And, similarly, if you redeemed 100 xPUSH, you would receive 100 PUSH back.

xPUSH is only minted when PUSH is deposited into the contract. Any time PUSH is sent to the xPUSH smart contract as rewards, it will increase the ratio of PUSH to xPUSH, generating a yield for all xPUSH holders.

### Example

John deposits 10,000 PUSH into xPUSH staking, when the exchange is 1.0. John receives 10,000 xPUSH in return for his 10,000 PUSH.

Other users stake a combined 90,000 additional PUSH, making the total staked amount of PUSH 100,000.

Now we have 100,000 xPUSH in total, and 100,000 PUSH in the xPUSH staking contract.

10,000 PUSH are now sent to the xPUSH reward contract, making the total amount of PUSH in the contract 110,000 now (learn where PUSH rewards come from below).

Since the total amount of xPUSH is still 100,000, but the PUSH shared among stakers is 110,000, the exchange rate (ratio) will now be 1.1 PUSH per xPUSH.

John can now redeem his 10,000 xPUSH to receive 11,000 PUSH in return.

Any new PUSH deposits at this point will receive xPUSH at the current exchange rate of 1 xPUSH per 1.1 PUSH (as per this example).

### How Does xPUSH Get Additional PUSH?

There are numerous sources of PUSH for the xPUSH holders:

* 20% of all PUSH minted on expansionary epochs will be deposited for xPUSH holders. This comes from the protocols PUSH allocation and has no negative impact on PSHARE staking.
